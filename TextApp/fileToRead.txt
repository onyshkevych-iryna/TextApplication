Just Planck processes are generalisation of termal noise, Langevin processes constitute generalisation of shot noise.
In general, Langevin processes permit larger class of problems to be solved than Planck processes and procedures.
Provide more intuition, but the class of such processes that can be reduced exactly to analysis limited. 
However, approximations (typically adiabatic ones) are easier to envision and to make the Langevin language.
Langevin methods, least for linear and nonilinear systems, have the simplicity of the circuit equations of electrical engineering. 
The noise source may arise from termal reservoirs Johnson noise, shot noise from the discreteness of particles.
Once the noise represented the voltage source with known moments, the physical nature of the source not longer important.
